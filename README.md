# Cheese Clicker

Cheese Clicker is a fun and interactive incremental (clicker) game that I'm developing as a personal project. The game revolves around producing and collecting cheese by clicking on a cheese icon. As you progress, you can purchase upgrades to increase your cheese production rate and earn cheese passively.
